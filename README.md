# An incredible project

This is the file you get to write to document your new project!

Also, don't forget to edit the couple of references in CONTRIBUTING.md that will need to be customized to link to this repo.
Update the LICENSE file with the correct date and attribution.

You also might want to create a .gitignore file to make things nicer.
